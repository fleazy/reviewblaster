# reviewblaster
Reviewblaster takes a VRBO link and will look through the reviews for potential unit numbers. It will display matching numbers with the review page they were found on. It comes packaged with an .ahk file (autohotkey) that can be macro'd to your keyboard. This .ahk will use the contents of your clipboard as input. This means that you must have the VRBO link in it's entirety in your clipboard before firing the .ahk script.

The intended workflow is:
Copy VRBO link to clipboard > press .ahk macro > wait for your results!

This application is coded with speed in mind, so duplicate results at this stage are expected.
