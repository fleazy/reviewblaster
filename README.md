# reviewblaster
Reviewblaster takes a VRBO link and will look through the reviews for potential unit numbers. It is coded with speed in mind. It comes packaged with an .ahk (autohotkey) file that can be macrod to the place of your choosing. The macro will use the contents of your clipboard as input for reviewblaster, so you'll need to have the VRBO link in it's entirety in your clipboard before pressing the macro key. This application is coded with speed as the top priority, so duplicate results are expected.
